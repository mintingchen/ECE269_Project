## Abstract
Titanic shipwreck is a famous historical tragedy, which took away around 1,500 passengers' life. This project aims to build machine learning models from the [titanic dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to predict which passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck. Parameters includes passenger class, sex, age, cabin, family relations, fare, ticket number, etc. To gain knowledge on various Machine Learning techniques, we will build models using Self Organizing Map (SOM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) and analyze the results of different techniques. If time permitted, we would like to take a step further and improve our model and generalize it; so it can predict survival results for other disasters.
